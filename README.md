# SuperPlanet
*Authors : Marin BOUTHEMY & Kossi NEROMA*


This project is a mobile application called SuperPlanet which is made to encourage children to clean up the planets.
It detects the number of garbage collected on two pictures (before and after the cleaning) and reward children with points accordingly.

We have used a machine learning algorithm for the image segmentation. It is a convolutional neural network made with the PyTorch framework.

It is made for the challenge of Pytorch Summer Hackathon 2020.

## Requirements
The library has some requirements :
 - React Native
 - Python
 - Django


# Machine Learning Explanation / Server Side


Write here the description of the algorithm and the files structure.





# App Explanation / Client Side


To install the app requirement you can run:

```
cd app
yarn install
react-native run-android
react-native start
```

## Files structure

The library contains the two following directories:

 - [app](https://github.com/mbouthemy/SuperPlanet/tree/master/app):which contains the mobile application:
     - Assets -> Images, Audios, Languages...
     - src/Views -> All the views of the application
     - src/Components -> All the components for the application
     - Inputs -> The inputs files.
 -  [gaialeague_ml](https://github.com/mbouthemy/SuperPlanet/tree/master/gaialeague_ml): which contains the server function used for Pytorch and Deep Learning comparison of the pictures
